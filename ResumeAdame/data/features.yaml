    I hold myself to a high standard and only know how to give my best effort. I am constantly looking for ways to improve and soak information from anyone I can. I believe in creating connections to help both parties flourish. 
    When I am asked for a task that requires teamwork or self-managed focus, I find a way to get the job done. I always strive to go above and beyond. I was raised to be competitive and I carry that in every aspect of my professional career.
